-- The tricky part of this question is to return NULL when there is no second highest salary. When we select a value from a template table, if the table does not have any value,
-- we will get a NULL
-- Note that we can use OFFSET to control the LIMIT. The LIMIT will start after the 2nd row when OFFSET=1.
SELECT
    (SELECT DISTINCT
            Salary
        FROM
            Employee
        ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary
;

--OR we can use IFNULL(), which returns the first value if it is not null, else return the second value.

SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
       FROM Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
