-- My solution. Define a variable @r that increments if the previous number is equal to the current number. A number that appears 3 times consecutively will have a @r = 3. 

SELECT DISTINCT num ConsecutiveNums 
FROM
(SELECT CASE WHEN pre_num = num THEN @r := @r + 1 ELSE @r := 1 END num_count, num
FROM
(SELECT @r := 1, LAG(num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY Id) pre_num, num FROM Logs) Temp) Temp2
WHERE num_count >= 3


-- Leetcode solution. This solution is very standard, but it becomes complicated if the consecutive number increases. So I think my solution is better.

SELECT DISTINCT
    l1.Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM
    Logs l1,
    Logs l2,
    Logs l3
WHERE
    l1.Id = l2.Id - 1
    AND l2.Id = l3.Id - 1
    AND l1.Num = l2.Num
    AND l2.Num = l3.Num
;
